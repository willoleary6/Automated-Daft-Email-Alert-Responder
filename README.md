# Automated-Daft-Email-Alert-Responder
Due to the housing crisis in Dublin, I have found previously that getting a viewing or even consideration for tenacy was based mostly on how quickly you could respond to the ad listing. Daft Email alerts helped but a person was still required to email the landord which would take time. This App will use a python libary to receive an email from Daft, scrape the ad listing details and compose an automated response to the Landord if they provided an email address. If not, an email with all the details will be sent to the potential tenant for them to contact the landlord.
